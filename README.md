# ToQIF: Export Thu ecard transactions to QIF file
## Introduction

ToQIF is a Greasemonkey script that export Thu ecard transactions to an QIF
file, ready for downloading and importing into GnuCash.

Note: you need to log into ecard.tsinghua, navigate to the transcation page,
enter a query to be able to see the QIF button. You need to enter the query to
see the lastest transactions. At most 20 transactions are displayed on one page,
and that is also the largest number of transactions in one QIF export.
